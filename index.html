        <h1>Your project was installed successfully!</h1>
        <h3>Next steps...</h3>
          <p>Open <em>this</em> index.html file (not the index.html file in the root directory) in a text editor <code>-> ./builds/development/index.html</code> and make some changes to the <code>h1</code> tag around line 22 and save the file.</p>
          <p>If you have your browser setup beside your text editor you will automatically see your changes. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
          <p>At this point you should notice that there is a file named <code>app.css</code> in the css directory and a file named <code>app.js</code> in the js directory. These are the files that we need to link to in the <code>builds/development/index.html</code>file.</p>
          <p>1. Re-name "css/bootstrap.min.css" to <code>css/app.css</code> (line 10).</p>
          <p>2. Re-name "js/bootstrap.min.js" to <code>js/app.js</code> (line 93).</p>
        <h3>CSS &amp; JS overrides...</h3>
          <p>To make your life easier (so you don't have to mess with Bootstrap's CSS or the JS files), just create two new files called 'myCSS.css' and 'myJS.js' and put them in <code>builds/development/css</code> and <code>builds/development/js</code> respectively. Now you can tweak your project using these two new files as they will be appended to the app.css and app.js files. Once you have done this, try adding<br> <code>body {<br>&nbsp;background: rgba(0, 198, 255, 0.13);<br>}</code><br> to your myCSS.css file. Hit save and checkout the new background colour.</p>
          <p>Just to prove that the myJS.js file will work as well, add the following to that file.<br><code>function myFunction() {<br>&nbsp; window.alert('This rocks'); <br>};</code><br>When you save the file, the browser will show an alert message when you click the button (a refresh might be required).  <button class='button tiny' onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button></p>
          <p>To add your own styles and functionality or overrides, you only have to modify these two files.</p>
          <p>When we move to production, only the two app files will get imported and minified greatly reducing the size of the project.</p>
        <h3>Add a slider...</h3>
          <p>If you need to implement a slider, try "Slick - the last carousel you'll ever need". It is very flexible and great for touch devices as well.</p>
          <p>The slider doesn't work yet so add this code to the myJS.js file:</p>
          <p><code>$(document).ready(function() {<br>&nbsp;
                  $('.autoplay').slick({<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    slidesToShow: 1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    slidesToScroll: 1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    speed: 2000,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    autoplay: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    autoplaySpeed: 3000,<br>&nbsp;
                  });<br>
                });
          </code></p>
          <p>Check out the feature set <a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" title="Get Slick" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
          <div class="slider autoplay">
            <div><img src="img/img_1.jpg" alt="img 1" /></div>
            <div><img src="img/img_2.jpg" alt="img 2" /></div>
            <div><img src="img/img_3.jpg" alt="img 3" /></div>
            <div><img src="img/img_4.jpg" alt="img 4" /></div>
            <div><img src="img/img_5.jpg" alt="img 5" /></div>
          </div>
          <p>To see the slider buttons correctly, you will have to adjust some paths in slick.css. Around line 6, change the path to ajax-loader.gif to: <br><code>../img/ajax-loader.gif</code><br> and change the path to the fonts around line 25 from fonts/*.* to: <br><code>../fonts/*.*</code> ( 5 instances )<br></p>
        <h3>Moving to Production...</h3>
          <p>Now that you have modified your web site and are happy with the results, it is time to move it to the production environment. These are the files that you will deploy to the production server. The only files that we are going to move are the essential ones like the <code>.html, .css, .js, .txt</code> and the image and font assets. These files will be minified, uglified or compressed as needed. The point is to make the smallest and fastest loading web site possible.</p>
          <p>There is only one command to run to achieve this.</p>
          <p>Back in the command line, quit the previous proccess if it is still running by typing <code>ctrl + C</code> and then type <br><code>NODE_ENV=production gulp prod</code><br> and hit the enter key.</p>
          <p>Once you run this command, all of the necessary files will be built to your <code>builds/production/</code> directory (which doesn't even exist yet until you run this command!)</p>
          <p>This workflow has started a new web server in <code>builds/production</code>. If you look at the source code you will see a minified version of the HTML. A quick look at the app.css or app.js files you can verify that the same thing has happened. Good luck editing any of those files!</p>
          <h3>So what's the Point?</h3>
          <p>The point is making your web site fast! Check out how big your <code>builds/development/</code>directory is, and compare it to your <code>builds/production/ </code>directory.</p>
          <p>If you have followed all of these instructions you will see that the <code>builds/development/</code> directory is ~ 1.1MB on disk compared to the <code>builds/production/</code> directory which weighs in at ~ 705 KB on disk. That's a savings of more than 60% to the size of your site when it goes to the production server! of course your mileage will vary depending on the assets you add to the project, but the point is well made that you will save big time in the end.</p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>1. You have setup your workstation with global installs of GIT, NODE, RUBY (if on a widows box) and GULP. Optionally you can globally install SASS, COMPASS and BROWSERIFY, if you need them.</p>
          <p>2. You have installed the NPM dependencies by running npm install in the command line.</p>
          <p>3. You have checked for any updates to the NPM dependencies by running npm-check-updates -u in the command line which downloaded any updates AND updated the package.json file.</p>
          <p>4. You followed the instructions at the top of the gulpfile.js file and ran gulp devSetUp to create the development environment in builds/development/.</p>
          <p>5. You altered the builds/development.index.html and saw your changes in livereload.</p>
          <p>6. You reduced the number of calls to external files.</p>
          <p>7. You added your own .css and .js files for adding your styles/functionality and overrides.</p>
          <p>8. You learned how to add a slider.</p>
          <p>9. Lastly, you built the production environment where all of your files and images have been minified.</p>
        <h3>Happy coding!</h3>
          <p>Now it's time to start working on your Bootstrap project.</p>
          <p>Use this file to start building your project:
          <code>builds/development/index.html</code></p>
          <p>Just a reminder:</p>
          <p>To start your development web server to reflect the changes in your browser, go back to the terminal and type:
          <code>gulp dev</code></p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
